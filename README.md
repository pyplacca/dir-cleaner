# dir-cleaner
Directory cleaner.

A CMD script for cleaning directories.

## What it does
This script cleans up a directory or multiple directories and properly sorts
out files in the given directory based on the file type.

***Eg:*** All image files are moved to an existing or newly created *"Images"*
	folder, video files to the *"Videos"* folder, audio files to the *"Audios"*
	folder, etc.

## Usage
Before using this script, make sure you have [Python](https://python.org/downloads) installed on your PC.

Now, assuming you have cloned this repository, and opened the CMD/Powershell window from the **dir-cleaner** folder, and would like to clean your desktop, run this command;
```
python cleaner.py %USERPROFILE%/Desktop
```
